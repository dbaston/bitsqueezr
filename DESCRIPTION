Title: Quantize Floating-Point Numbers for Improved Compressibility
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel Baston <dbaston@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Daniel Baston <dbaston@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a implementation of floating-point quantization algorithms for use in precision-preserving 
             compression, similar to the approach taken in the 'netCDF operators' (NCO) software package and 
             described in Zender (2016) <doi:10.5194/gmd-2016-63>.
